# Fake News Predictor using LSTM

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data# 

This repository contains an implementation of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict fake news . The project is developed entirely within a single Jupyter Notebook for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model using LSTM, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to classify news articles as fake or real. This task is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring the reliability of information sources.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the text data for training.
- **Model Building:** Construction and compilation of the LSTM model.
- **Training:** Training the model on the corpus with appropriate hyperparameters.
- **Prediction:** Classifying news articles as fake or real based on the input text.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
